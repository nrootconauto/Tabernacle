This is a project to continue the legacy of Terry Davis(RIP) via  making a HolyC llvm frontend with libaries from templeOS that be used to run TempleOS at native speeds on different architectures.
##  Anyone Can Contribute Now
This is a project that will allow any program who knows C to contribute,because i am making a "checklist" of basic things that can be written by anyone, including beginners and masters  ,so here is the Roadmap
